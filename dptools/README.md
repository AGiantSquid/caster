#tools by Douglas Parent
==================

Except for argparse.py, these tools were made by Douglas Parent, not me. He posted them publicly on the currently defunct speechcomputing.com. (See link below.) I find them to be extremely useful, and although his single-line note about licensing only talks about modification,  he seems to have been trying to be very permissive.  That said, if you are Douglas Parent and you would like me to take these down, or if this is in any way a violation of Github policy, please contact me and I will take them down immediately.
