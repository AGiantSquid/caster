#Caster Rules

Dragonfly is a powerful framework for mapping voice commands to actions. Caster gives the user:
* a pre-made set of rules to start with as a base, 
* tools with which to modify the pre-made rules,
* the Context Stack, a way of tracking state between commands.

##Pre-made Rules

Out-of-the-box, Caster gives the user new mouse navigation commands (see the Mouse page), text formatting and navigation commands, and programming-language specific rules. See the Quick Reference for more details.
