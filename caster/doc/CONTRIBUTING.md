##Contributing

*How can I help?*

1. **Write code.** There is [a lot which needs to be done](https://github.com/synkarius/caster/issues). If you can program in Python, please write some code. Note that all pull requests should be sent to the "develop" branch.
2. **Write documentation.** [The wiki](https://github.com/synkarius/caster/wiki) is pretty sparse, and there is no ReadTheDocs/ etc. for Caster yet. 
3. **Speak.** Tell others who might be interested in Caster. Join our discussions on the issues page. The more the merrier, and your thoughts are welcome and encouraged.
