##Contributing

*How can I help?*

1. **Write code.** There is [a lot which needs to be done](https://github.com/synkarius/caster/issues). If you can program in Python, please write some code. Note that all pull requests should be sent to the "develop" branch.
2. **Write documentation.** The [ReadTheDocs page](http://caster.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) is pretty sparse. (Everything on [the wiki](https://github.com/synkarius/caster/wiki) will be getting moved to the ReadTheDocs, so create new docs as .MD files.)
3. **Speak.** Tell others who might be interested in Caster. Join our discussions on the issues page and [Gitter](https://gitter.im/synkarius/caster). The more the merrier, and your thoughts are welcome and encouraged.
